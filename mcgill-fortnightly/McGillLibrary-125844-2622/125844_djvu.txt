EDITORiAL 

A FTER some weeks of discussion and experiment 
we are now able to introduce The McGill Fort- 
nightly Review, an independent journal, which 
herewith makes its bow. 



Even the casual reader of The McGill Daily must 
by now have become aware that this year a new and 
more lively spirit of criticism is making its influence 
felt in all branches of student activity. The ordinary 
undergraduate, it is apparent, is exhibiting a keener 
interest than ever before in matters of student govern- 
ment, and is taking a consciously critical attitude 
upon the numerous debatable issues that have stirred 
the interest of the undergraduate body since the 
opening of the college term a month and a half ago. 
The correspondence columns of the Daily have been 
crowded with letters of a controversial and critical 
nature, and what has been written by a score or so of 
correspondents has been discussed with lively interest 
by the many. That we have been able to find the 
necessary undergraduate financial support to make 
the independent existence of this journal a possibility 
is but another instance of the awakening of a keener 
critical spirit. 

* * * # 

The first question to awaken a large amount of 
interest arose with the announcement of the inability 
of the Students’ Council to continue in its separate 
distinctive form the Literary Supplement to the 
Daily. At once letters began to appear, the general 
tenour of the majority of which was that an individual 
literary paper should be maintained even at the cost 
of some financial sacrifice. A suggestion was finally 
made by Mr. T. H. Harris, Intercollegiate Editor of 
the Daily, whereby Saturday's issue, a relatively un- 
important one, would be cut down to a single sheet 




and a literary supplement identical in form with that 
of last year published. This could be done without 
any additional cost. The Managing Board of the Daily 
was strongly in favour of this plan, but the advertis- 
ing manager felt that it might result in some loss of 
advertising and would, in fact, amount to a breach 
of faith with advertisers who had contracted to take 
space in a four-page newspaper on Saturdays. The 
Council suggested a compromise. It proposed to 
allow the Saturday literary section to be cut, though 
without being folded in the tabloid form of last yt ai 
The literary editor of the Daily and those who were 
to assist him felt that enough interest had been aroused 
in the matter to enable them to apply directly to the 
student body for the necessary funds to establish a 
separate literary journal to be supported by subscrip- 
tion. They accordingly left the Daily and established 
the Fortnightly Review. There has been no question 
of any break with the Daily. The Managing Board 
of the college newspaper was as anxious as we were to 
have last year’s literary supplement continued. It was 
impossible, however, to come to an arrangement with 
the advertising manager, and a separation became 
necessary. Our unwillingness to accept the Council's 
suggested compromise should not be interpreted in 
any way as an affront to the Council. The Council 
has never had any desire to “suppress the supplement”; 
the majority of its members simply felt that the finan- 
cial condition of the Students’ Society did not justify 
the expenditure of five hundred dollars on a supple- 
ment like that of ldst year, while the objections of the 
advertising manager prevented the adoption of Mr 
Harris’s plan.

In the past the meaning of the word Tolerance has 
been as variable as the meaning of the word Liberty. 
Too often lias the liberty of one been the enslavement 
of others; too often has tolerance of one opinion implied 
the suppression of others. 

It is our firm intention to eschew such practices

The McGill Fortnightly Review 



The Review is an independent journal and, as such, 
it has a right to an independent opinion ot its own on 
all matters. The Editors will express that opinion in 
the Editorial columns. But this emphatically does 
not mean that we shall suppress the contributions ol 
those who disagree with us. We shall be glad to receive 
and publish articles taking any attitude whatever. We 
reserve only that they shall be ol sufficient literary 
merit. The body of the McGill Fortnightly Review 
will be devoted to purely literary, artistic and scientific 
matter, but space will also be reserved to do duty as 
an open forum, wherein students of McGill may voice 
their thoughts on the affairs of the student body, 
saying freely whatever they may feel* 

* * * # 

W E have read with a certain amount of disappoint- 
ment not unmingled with surprise, the new 
constitution of the Daily which was ratified 
by the Students" Council on November the tenth. The 
whole function of the editorial seems to be made use- 
less by Clause 3 which states that "When any contro- 
versial question arises among the undergraduates, the 
McGill Daily shall assume a neutral attitude m its 
editorial column, and shall not oppose any decision 
of the Council.” Apart from the possibility arising 
that neutrality might be in opposition to some decision 
of the Council, the assumption on all occasions of a 
strictly impartial attitude prevents the Daily from 
takixig a definite stand on any question whatever, 
whether in favour of what its editors believe to he m 
the best interests of the Students" Society or against 
what they feel to be detrimental to those interests. 
It makes for equivocation and shilly-shallying, and 
at once puts the editorial column on the level of a 
harmless, meaningless and colourless column of ‘Miller 
devoted to urging the student to work hard, to attend 
rooters" practices and support this or that deserving 
activity* 

* * * # 

M cGILL students in English are very fortunate in 
having the privilege of listening to a course 
of lectures from so distinguished a poet as Bliss 
Carman* Not only as a writer, but as a lecturer and 
reader of his poems, Mr. Carman is well known here, 
having given a reading and interpretative address 
at McGill as recently as last winter. That the English 
Department should have obtained his services as a 
lecturer on the subject of Canadian literature marks 
the beginning of what may well be a new epoch in 
the history of the relations between Canadian univer- 
sities and Canadian art. In addition to lecturing on 
literature, Mr. Carman is devoting some time to 
an analysis of the subject-matter and mechanics 
of poetry and to a discussion with student writers of 
any of their poems which they care to submit to him. 
This is indeed a welcome and much needed service, 
and one for which all of us who are subject to the 
“furor poeticus” should be duly grateful 

* * * * 

W e breathed a sigh of relief when it was announced 
that the Harold Lloyd Rugby Trophy had been 
refused. In our opinion the proposal touched the 
rock-bottom of absurdity. The suggestion emanated- 
and this gives us some small satisfaction— not from 
McGill, but from the manager of one of our large 
moving picture theatres* The excellent pantomme 
at the Queen's game was used by him to further 
his scheme of advertisement, and it was he who 



wrote to Harold Lloyd asking for the cup* We 
cannot, however, shut our eyes to the fact that the 
Athletic Board, in a moment of forgetfulness, sanction- 
ed the proposal, and that Mr. Shaughnessy gave the 
assurance that McGill would accept* Not till events 
had reached this dangerous stage was public opinion 
brought to bear, and the trophy refused* 

Unfortunately this regrettable incident has already 
found a parallel. On Saturday, October 31st, the Mc- 
Gill Band, in the McGill uniform, paraded the streets 
of Montreal and the grounds of the M. A* A. A. carry- 
ing placards advertising “The Freshman”. The pay 
received from the Capitol Theatre for this public use 
of McGills name was devoted to sending the perform- 
ers to Toronto. We can admire the determination of^ 
the band to secure a trip, and their ingenuity in raising 
the money, but we can see little difference between 
this and the incident of the trophy. In both cases Mc- 
Gill was made a party to an advertisement, and the 
same reasons which lead us to condemn the one apply 
with equal force to the other* So would we feel, were 
a scion of a princely house to lend his name to a patent 
medicine* It is one of those things which is distinctly 
not done* 

* # # * 

It was an unpleasant experience to sit through the 
McGill- Varsity game and hear a large body of under- 
graduates frequently booing the decisions of the referee. 
It was a still more unpleasant experience to read, after 
the excitement of the game was over, an article in the 
Daily which cast the very gravest reflections upon the 
fairness of the particular referee in question, in language 
as vulgar as it was bad in taste. One would like to think 
that McGill was above this sort of thing* We are very 
glad that Mr* Shaughnessy has written a letter to the 
Daily stating that in his opinion the game was handled 
with the utmost impartiality, 

# # * * 

W E wish to acknowledge with thanks a grant of 
fifty dollars from the Arts Undergraduate 
Society, and also to express our sincere appre- 
ciation of the services of those students who have 
assisted us in the collection of subscriptions.

The Flight of College Time 

Stephen Leacock 

W ITHIN a few weeks it will be twenty-five years 
since I entered the service of McGill University. 
It was on January afternoon in the last year 
of the reign of Queen Victoria, that I took off my college 
cap in room number 5 of the Arts Building and 
delivered a lecture on the government of England. 
The good old Queen, I remember, was reported ill 
immediately after the lecture. _ 

This humble anniversary is of interest to nobody 
but myself. My first lecture fell as harmlessly as a 
raindrop in a river of talk, and before so very long 
my last lecture will ebb away as noiselessly as the 
water running out of a sink. But the anniversary at 
least gives me a fitting point of departure for a few 
reflections upon the men and things of twenty-five 
years ago and the college of today. 

1 recall, in the first place, when I came to McGill 
there was much discussion of the need of a new Arts 
Building. It was pointed out that the great increase 
of numbers in a family that now counted over two 
hundred students, was crowding the Building to suf- 
focation. Classes of twenty, thirty, and even forty 
students, were massed in a single class room. I re- 
member that a brilliant proposal was started to the 
effect that it might be possible to knock down the 
inside of the building and to keep the outside, the 
beauty of which had already been a subject of remark. 

I can' recollect also the pleasurable excitement occa- 
sioned by the gathering of the first basket of beautiful 
mushrooms in the basement of the building. 

Another subject of discussion and remark at this 
period, especially among the men of the second year, 
was the fact that the freshmen at the time seemed 
especially young and childish. Indeed the men of the 
upper years went further and drew attention to the 
childishness of the second year, while the older profes- 
sors declared that the whole student body grew more 
childish every year. On the other hand the students 
of that day drew attention to the fact that the pro- 
fessors were too old and that many of them were so 
old as to be getting childish. Not being used, at that 
time, to this apparent spread of increasing childish- 
ness all over the University, I felt alarmed at it. Ihere 
was a good deal of discussion, too, of the question at 
what age a professor ought to be compelled by law to 
get out and go away; some students said thirty-five, 
some, forty. 

I recall also- as something that seems very' far 
away from our own time— the controversies that went 
on over the peculiar disappearance of 1 looks from the 
College library. It was held that no McGill student 
would steal— that stealing was an act to which no 
student at the college would lower himself. And it 
was therefore deduced that a number of burglars had 
art fully qualified as undergraduates in order to steal 
copies ' of Hall and Knight's Algebra and Vander 
Smissen's German Grammar. It is interesting to note 
how completely this old question of whether a McGill 
student can steal has passed out of all discussion and 
is now settled. . 

There were of course, plenty of other topics of 
discussion — j’en passe el des meilleurs . 1 recollect 

hearing much said in those old days about what a 
college girl would do after leaving college. It seemed 
a shame that she should merely get married and have 
a home and children. On the other hand the brilliant 



theory had already been advanced that a .girl with a 
thousand dollars worth of algebra in her makes a better 
wife than a girl who can t read and write. 

We talked, too. of the football team and whether 
to send it to the sea-side, and of starting a college 
magazine, and of why the graduates don’t take more 
interest in giving money to the undergraduates — and 
all such themes and topics as these. 

But surely I need not labour longer the point of this 
little essay. Nay, rather, if there is anybody who 
doesn’t see it, let me tell him in a single sentence, and 
say that the interests and ideas, the problems and the 
endeavours of twenty-five years ago were much the 
same as those at the present moment, and much the 
same as those that will obtain when another quarter 
century has gone by. 

To all of this there is a moral. A college is an unend- 
ing thing, with a life and a continuity of its own. Those 
of us who study and work in it pass on and the college 
remains. All that we do or accomplish in it lives as a 
fragment added to its history- small but enduring. 

And some of the best things that we can do as a 
contribution to the life history of our college, are things 
that make, perhaps, but little showing on the surface- - 
or little that can be measured and proved in terms of 
dollars and cents. Of such a nature is this present 
enterprise— the revival of a college magazine, which 
has given occasion to this theme. 

A college magazine, if it is of the right sort, is bom 
into a life of poverty. It knows nothing of the grandiose 
finance, the spacious advertising and the metropolitan 
make-believe of the University Daily Newspaper. It 
is supported by the alms of the faithful and faith is apt 
to be feeble in finance. 

But it represents a work of the creative spirit fit to 
rank with any of the activities of a university. 

As such I send to it herewith this article, my personal 
good wishes and the more tangible testimony of one 
Canadian dollar. 



Not of The Dust 

L ET us imagine ourselves goldfish: 

We would swim in a crystal bowl; 

The cold water would go swish 
Over our naked bodies: we would have no soul. 

In the morning the syrupy sunshine 
Would sparkle oil our tails and fins; 

We would have to stop talking of "Mine" 

And “Thine”; we would have no sins. 

Come, then, let us dream of goldfish, 

Let us put away intellect and lust. 

Be but a red gleam in a crystal dish, 

But kin of the cold sea, not of the dust.

BOOKS 

The Flying Osip 

Modern Russian Short Stories, Translated by 
Wm. Friedland and Pirochnikoff 
The International Publishers 

npHOSE who are keen students of international 
literature and are not swayed by political hatred 
win welcome with great interest the news of the 
recent issue of a volume of Russian stories by the 
International Publishers. This volume is a collection 
of short stories by the" new school” of Russian writers 
and bears the title of "The Flying Osip”, the first story 
in the book. 

Modem Russian writers are divided into various 
camps of “pro-reds” and “anti-reds” while some writers 
prefer to call themselves neutral. 

When the November Revolution, led by Lenin, 
broke forth in all its fury, many prominent poets and 
writers were so appalled by the catastrophic change, 
which they imagined would take place, that they put 
themselves on record as evelasting enemies of the Soviet 
regime. One of these “antis” w'as the eminent Leonid 
Andreyev, Merezhkovsky, Bunin and others emi- 
grated to Paris where they augmented the rising anti- 
Bolshevik colony. But many though not com- 
prehending the ideals of the revolution and to some 
extent disagreeing with certain methods of the revolu- 
tionaries preferred to remain in their native land and 
see things for themselves. Among these, two names 
are prominent to readers on this side of the water — 
Gorky and Zamiatin, the author of “We". The No- 
vember Revolution claims as its loyal sons Brinsov, 
the founder and leader of Russian symbolism, Blok, 
the famous poet, the great majority of the Futuristic 
school who probably believed in a “futurism 
of happiness,” and a host of others. Among those 
who have altered their policy of combating the Soviets 
and are at present considered as “November Revo- 
lutionists” shines the luminary, Alexei Tolstoy. 

Russia has now entered upon a new era of literary 
endeavour and creative art in general. A new school 
of young writers has sprung up, preaching the ideals 
of a new social order, a new Russia. No longer do we 
find the morbid realism of a Dostoevsky or a minute 
psychological analysis of an Andreyev. In short, that 
melancholic interpretation of life, that acute suffering 
which so reflected Russian Tsarist life and which in- 
cidentally made Russian literature so distinct from 
others, has become extinct. On the ruins of the old 
order has arisen a new, and the literature of the New 
Russia reflects the social life of the New Russia. Every- 
thing is new. There is no room for. pessimism, no room 
for down-heartedness,' ‘Create” is the cry of the people, 
and this cry is accompanied by dynamic force, strength, 
cheerfulness, courage, and all the qualities necessary for 
real constructive work. Can we then wonder that “The 
Flying Osip” claims the interest of all keen students 
of literature? There is a wealth of new material of 
interesting study in store for us. “The Flying Osip” 
is but a pioneer work and works of this kind will un- 
doubtedly claim the attention of the literary world 
to a greater extent in the future. 

In conclusion I should like to pay tribute to Messrs. 
Friedland and Pirochnikoff for their excellent trans- 
lations of the stories in the Flying Osip. Their mast- 
terful rendition of the Russian into American slang 



where necessary, and their successful attempt to trans- 
plant the sense and feeling of the original into the 
English demonstrate their remarkable talent. And 
what is rather beneficial to the reader is the addition 
of a glossary to the book which defines the abbreviated 
colloquial expressions so common in Russia today.

The Harper Prize Short Stories 

Harper Brothers, New York 

T HIS is .an age of prize competitions. Such is 
the beginning I planned for this review but upon 
reflection, it occurred to me that there is really 
very slight ground for speaking of the present epoch 
as one pre-eminent for such competitions. Did not 
Greece have her Olympic Games, in which poets, 
poetesses and poetasters were rewarded in common 
with runners, jumpers, wrestlers and discoboli? Has 
not the theory of stimulating endeavour in all fields 
by dangling the laurel been practised ever since 
Adam’s Fall? At any rate, Harper and Brothers have 
fallen in with the tradition, and the result is the appear- 
ance under one cover of twelve prize short stories 
selected from over ten thousand stories which aspired 
to the glorious ribbons. 

The best story in “The Harper Prize Short Stories” 
is, without doubt, Conrad Aiken’s “The Disciple,” 
with its strange, fantastic plot and its truly fascinating 
style. “When Judas meets Ahasver” is the theme of 
this story and it is , owing to its extravaganza, much 
in the same school with certain typical works of Poe, 
Hawthorne and Wells. 

As “The Disciple” is the most entertaining story 
in the book, so “Loutre” is the most profound, Here 
we have an important contribution to the science of 
ideology or perhaps psychology. The growth of an 
idea, which is unique in not representing a piece of 
tangible nature, is carefully traced from its inception 
to its maturing into the Frankenstein of its author. 
The author of the idea is a young Parisian who tells 
an editor that he is planning a novel, giving at the 
same time a sketchy account of it. The novel he never 
writes, but the story spreads and “Loutre” the title 
to.be given the work, is soon oh the lips of the coffee- 
drinkers of the boulevards while everyone has either 
read it or reviewed it. 

“Redbone” by Miss Tar lean is another very good 
prize story but of a quite different type from the tw'o 
already discussed. This tale is or the old-fashioned 
inhabitants of the Cote Joyeuse in Louisiana, the 
Creoles already immortalized in English letters by 
George Cable and Lafcadio Hearn. Baptiste Grabbo, 
the hero of “Redbone”, ponders over the beauty ex- 
pressed in the work of his friend, the grave-stone cutter 
and master craftsman, coming thereby to feel the 
need of extraordinary' monuments with figures of 
passing grace and loveliness to deck the future of 
himself and his squaw. Such he orders from the stone- 
cutter, for he can trust their selection to none but 
himself. How Mrs. Grabbo’s grave was untimely 
filled with the flesh and bones of her lover, whom 
Baptiste caught in flagrante delicto, is the central 
point of the story and cannot be divulged in a review. 
There are two fairly ingenious stories in the volume

After the Balt Was Over 

Eugene Forsey 

L ORD Randolph Churchill once said that “there 
is a very widespread feeling that any expression 
of opinion from those who have no claim to the 
monumental age of 101, is a breach of decorum, almost 
an act of indecency, and an indication of incurable 
vice/' Personal experience has, on the whole, con- 
firmed this depressing reflection; and it seems partic- 
ularly hazardous to comment on anything so involved 
as the present political situation. Senators, constitu- 
tional lawyers, and even newspaper editors, have only 
succeeded in adding to the confusion. But when 
“practical men" fall out, the political theorist, be he 
never so humble, comes by his own; and I have been 
much heartened by the “McGill Daily's" announce-* 
ment that “among the contributors to the 'Fortnightly 7 

will be Dr, Leacock Bliss Carman and 

Eugene Forsey, noted authority on political problems." 
After that, mere gratitude would compel me to break 
silence. 

It is as easy to be wise after the event as it is rash 
to prophesy; and so far the only certain thing about 
the election result is its uncertainty. Nevertheless, a 
few salient facts do emerge from the tangle. The Prime 
Minister's avowed reason for seeking a new mandate 
was that he had been hampered by lack of the decisive 
majority necessary for strong government* He even 
declared that if the result were unsatisfactory, he 
“would not hesitate to ask for a second dissolution." 
With eight of his Ministers, he has now suffered personal 
defeat r ^und in seven Provinces he can muster a total 
# of only 39 followers. Still, he has chosen to remain in 
office for the time being. The official statement said 
that there were three courses open to him: (1) To meet 
Parliament; (2) To ask for an immediate dissolution; 
or (3 ) To resign, recommending His Excellency to call 
on Mr. Meighen. As Mr. Meighen at once pointed out, 
the second course was really impossible. Mr. King 
had had his chance and lost it; and, following the 
Victoria precedent of 1858, the Governor-General 
would certainly have refused a second request to 
dissolve. In this regard, the Premier merely accepted 
the inevitable. 

But his decision to awai* the verdict of Parliament 
has provoked torrents of wrath from the Conservative 
press, and a fine crop of fantastic constitutional theories. 
The climax is reached in Senator Lynch-Staunton’s 
solemn pronouncement that if Mr. King fails to get 
a seat before the House opens, he automatically ceases 
to be Premier. It would be just as sensible to say that 
if he fails to join the Knights of Columbus, he auto- 
matically ceases to be Premier. As a matter of prac- 
tical convenience, it is one of the conventions of Cabinet 
Government that Ministers must secure a seat in either 
House within a reasonable time after appointment. 
But the custom has no legal sanction whatever. 

Nor need we take very seriously the charge that 
Mr. King is “usurping" power. The low tariff groups 
are in a distinct majority in the House, though not 
in the country; and the fate of Cabinets is decided in 
the House, not by popular vote. Mr. King has cer- 
tainly a much better chance of Progressive support 
than Mr. Meighen; and if he likes to risk it, he has a 
perfect constitutional right to do so. 

Whether it is good tactics is another question. The 



spectacle of a Prime Minister directing affairs from the 
Distinguished Strangers’ Gallery would have delighted 
Gilbert and Sullivan. It will be deeply appreciated 
by the Opposition. “Such a gallant feat of arms was 
never seen before.” Another year’s uncertainty, another 
year of government by grace of opposition members, 
may provoke the country into giving the Liberals an 
unmistakable notice to quit. Mr. King, however, is 
no fool, but a very astute politician. He evidently 
believes that good times are beginning, and that 
whoever goes to the country a year hence will be 
returned in a blaze of glory. Why shouldn’t he get the 
halo, instead of Mr. Meighen! 

Any Government, in the existing circumstances, 
can be no more than a “Ministry of Caretakers". Even 
that must depend on Progressive aid a very doubtful 
quantity—; and Mr. King’s patience is likely to wear, 
rather thin under the strain of another year’s tight — 
rope walking. Harmlessness is not enough; we must 
have vigourous leadership. That is why the next elec- 
tion will take place before twelve months are over. 
When it comes, features of the present situation which 
are already apparent, will stand out in a strong light. 

In the first place, Canada has followed the lead of 
Britain and the United States in pronouncing for a 
return to the two-party system. We have seen the last 
of the Progressives as a serious factor in Canadian 
politics. In Quebec, the Maritimes, and British Colum- 
bia, they never really took root. In Ontario their 
defeat was a foregone conclusion, ever since the ex- 
posure of the Drury Government’s misdeeds. But the 
Prairie Provinces were the citadel of Agrarianism; 
and the Liberal sweep in Saskatchewan, coupled with 
the heavy gains of the Liberals in Alberta, and of the 
Conservatives in both Manitoba and Alberta, came as 
a surprise to everyone. Mr. Forke, dour and unin- 
piring, was of course no match for his antagonists. 
The Saskatchewan victory was largely a well-deserved 
personal triumph for Premier Dunning, one of the 
ablest of Canadian Liberals ; while the Western gains 
of the Conservatives were an equal tribute to the 
brilliant leadership of Rt. Hon. Arthur Meighen. But 
that is not the whole story. Hopelessly divided among 
themselves, the Progressives have cut a sorry figure in 
Parliament; treating us, among other things, to the 
amazing sight of a Party Leader and his Chief Whip 
voting on opposite sides in the Budget division. They 
certainly did not make the most of their position as the 
indispensable prop of the Government. Their tariff 
reductions have proved almost worthless; and the 
West has evidently got tired of the seesawing for which 
the third party was responsible. 

For the moment, the feeble remnant of the Pro- 
gressives seems once more to hold the balance of power. 
But its position is precarious, even in its strongholds; 
its organization has never been brilliant; and Mr. 
Woodsworth’s Vancouver speech suggests that the 
authority of Mr. Forke lies lightly on the “Ginger 
Group.” This handful of Radicals can be depended 
on to make things interesting. It has shown far more 
affinity for Labour than for the brethren on the Liberal 
benches; and it will not submit tamely to be carried 
over as a body to either of the two great Parties. 

Still clearer and more decisive than the Progressive 
defeat is the collapse of the Patenaude Movement. 



6 



The McGill Fortnightly Review 



Remorselessly stage-managed by the "die-hards”, 
it has succeeded in electing only one member, and 
even his Patenaudeism is questionable. Many French- 
Canadians have apparently learned nothing and for- 
gotten nothing. Of the other Conservatives elected. 
Sir George Perley never swerved from his allegiance 
to Mr. Meighen; and Messrs. White and Bell did not 
join in the campaign of repudiation. IIow far Mr. 
Patenaude was really the tool of lhe‘‘die hards” and 
how far he was using them for his own ends we are not 
likely to find out. His “bubble reputation” is gone; and 
his defeat has been accepted by Conservatives else- 
where, and by the party loyalists here, with varying 
degrees of relief or enthusiasm. His friends claim that 
he has done great things in reducing Liberal majority. 
Mr. Meighen’s followers believe, on the other hand, 
that the Conservative Party of Quebec lost at least 
as much in public respect as it gained by any camou- 
flage. 

Mr. Meighen wanted to come to Quebec. Many 
Conservative candidates would have welcomed him. 
Certainly he could have given the lie to stories that 
he was trying to embroil us in foreign wars. It is a. 
strange irony by which the most Nationalistic of 
Conservative leaders is denounced for his “Imperial- 
ism.” Some Liberals claim no such propaganda was 
used. But I can personally testify to at least one 
French-Canadian, belonging to a well-known Montreal 
family, a veteran of the "Great War, and an experienced 
business man, who said in pier feet seriousness that if 
the Conservatives got in there’d be a war to-morrow! 
Rural electors, of course, would be better informed. 

Why did Mr, Meighen stay away? Knowing his 
character, I venture to offer an explanation of my own. 
For years his English-speaking enemies in this city 
have 'been telling him he was hopeless as a leader. We 
have all heard how much better they could do if they 
had the chance. Apparently, he decided to let them 
them try. Anyone who knows their mental calibre 
could hâve foreseen the result, and probably no one 
was less surprised than Mr. Meighen, 

His personal triumph in Portage la Prairie, in spite 
of a large Montreal slush fund sent there to defeat 
hint; and his undreamed of success throughout the 
country, should teach the Quebec Conservatives a 
lesson. For the victory was fairly won. The Conser- 
vative Leader preached one and the same policy from 
Coast to Coast. He told the people what he believed 
to be right, not what he thought they wanted to hear. 
It is to be hoped we have heard the last of the sed- 
ulously propagated myth that he has “no personal 
magnetism.” The night before the election, after a long 
and strenuous campaign he was visibly at the end of his 
resources. Yet when the Ottawa speech was fin- 
nishech he held a veritable levée, greeting old friends 
with the warmth and enthusiasm of a boy. The truth 
is, his enemies among the English-speaking Conser- 
vatives of Montreal dread an ability and honesty 
which they are incapable of appreciating. But they 
have tried their own methods, and failed dismally* 
Henceforth they may have the sense to let the 
Conservative Party run its own affairs; and it 
is a safe prophecy that the next time we shall 
see Mr. Meighen conducting his own campaign m 
this Province. 

Any survey of the present political situation must 
necessarily end on a note of doubt and Questioning, 
for the play is not yet played out. We have seen the 
the first act, no more. The crisis has yet to come; the 
.elution is wholly unpredictable. 



MUSIC 

The Boston Symphony Orchestra 

T HE difficulties attending our local concert- 
managers, in the last few years, have become 
almost insuperable. A bare modicum of recitals, 
vocal and instrumental, apart, it indubitably appeared 
that Montreal would never again be visited by any of 
America’s splendid symphony orchestras. 

Formerly, our “picture paiaces” had consented to 
receive these visiting orchestras within their spacious 
and altogether suitable halls; but at the beginning 
of last season, these same theatres adopted the policy 
that, for the future, their hospitality could not be 
depended upon. In fact, they closed their doors for- 
ever. 

The people of Montreal therefor had ample cause 
to hail as a great musical event the coming of the 
Boston Symphony Orchestra, on November the second. 
Such fears as may have been entertained as to the 
acoustic qualities of the Forum were soon dispelled 
when the concert began; for the uncovered steel-arches 
of the building at no time gave any sound resonance, 
or echo. Thé vast curtains, hanging from the roof 
to the floor, and surrounding the stage, probably 
absorbed more sound than was necessary': the true 
pitch of certain instrumenta was not always discernible. 
A ceiling suspended over the orchestra would have 
remedied these effects. The reputation of Serge 
Kussevitzky, the present conductor of the Boston 
Symphony "Orchestra, had preceded him on this, his 
first visit, to Montreal. Already in his first year in 
Boston, he had been proclaimed a worthy successor 
of Dr. Muck and Monteux, and even ranked as a rival 
to Stokowski of Philadelphia and Damrosch of New 
York. 

To watch Kussevitzky conduct one gathers the 
impression of a man who has complete mastery of 
his art; a man whose emotions never get the better 
of his technique. The fastest tempo never slips beyond 
his control; the softest part is never sentimental. Ilis 
action is sparing; while, frequently on leading to a 
crescendo, he drops both his arms, and allows the 
orchestra to move on its own impetus. The strength 
of the man’s personality comes out more keenly at 
such moments than at any other time. 

No one can quarrel with the fact that Weber’s Ou- 
verture to “Euryanthe” makes a perfect opening 
number for a symphony concert. The vague melodies 
of this delicate piece serve well the purpose of creating 
an atmosphere and fostering a receptive mood among 
the listeners. A vast audience of five thousand (the 
figure is that of the daily Press) requires to have 
its unaccustomed ears timed; so that however well 
performed a first number, as the Ouverture, no one 
could be expected to say very much about it. And no 
one did. Besides, so many were late: particularly in 
the well dressed section of the auditorium. 

The second number of the programme, Tchaikowsky's 
No. 6 Symphony “Pathétique”, was the evening’s 
“pièce de résistance” (inevitable phrase!). For those 
who have never heard it before, this symphony must 
present some serious problem: the first movement 
being divided into four parts, and constituting a whole 
symphony by itself, with coda and full thematic de- 
velopment. 

The second movement (Allegro congrazia,) relates

Talks on the Mountain 

C ANADIAN nationalism is a myth, McCrae. 
The average Canadian does not know the meaning 
of the term— except, of course, the French - 
Canadian, who is ahead of us in that respect.” 

‘‘If you are going to start on that tack, Evan, for 
goodness sake wait till we reach a more secluded spot. 
You always become violent.” . . 

“X feel violent. We are suffering from an inferiority 
complex. Look at that students’ meeting the other day. 
If there is one place where one would expect a developed 
nationalism it is at our Universities. Was there any 
evidence of it when the question of the Scarlet Key 
Society arose? Not a bit. Several speakers appealed 
to the' students to reject that idea as being foreign to 
McGill, and to evolve one of our own. If there had 
been any national pride anywhere, the appeal could 
have been answered in only one way; the McGill 
student body answered it in the other way. They 
thought the Scarlet Key a good idea, so they adopted 
it— and thus saved themselves the trouble of evolving 
a Canadian equivalent,” 

“You’re bigoted, Evans. You want a Balkan nation- 
alism. You want us to retire into ourselves and to 
become touchy upon the subject of nationality. That 
attitude won’t do in America.” _ 

"You can’t drive me into that corner, McCrae. 1 
know as well as you the dangers of Chauvinism and 
Fascism and kindred ‘isms’. But there is no possible 
chance of that in Canada; the danger is all trom the 
opposite quarter. What 1 mean by my attitude is 
this, that a nation without a character of its own is a 
mere encumbrance on the face of the earth. The duty 
of a nation —like that of an individual— is to contribute 
something novel and original to civilisation, not to 
ape or reflect palely the characteristics of others. 
Such nations do not count; they have moral significance. 
That is the position of Canada.” 

“You cannot deduce that from the last students 
meeting. You exaggerate, as usual. ’ . . 

“Bnt I do deduce it, McCrae. It is fair to take the 
Scarlet Kev as a test case. The vote went against 
Canada. One more custom, as old as McGill sport 
itself, went by the board.” 

‘‘It is not so bad as all that, The students merely 
wanted to do something to organise entertainment, 
and they imported this from Dartmouth. That was 
all ** 

“I am sorrv, but that was not all. 1 do not. care a 
fig for the Scarlet Key itself; what matters is the atti- 
tude of mind towards it. When it was pointed out 
that no other University in Canada possessed such an 
organisation, someone arose and said that though at 
the moment our chief games were played with Queens 
and Toronto, the time was not far distant when we 
would be playing more games in the States than in 
Canada; the implication being that we should Ameri- 
canise now to adapt ourselves to this change. Hunk 
of that McCrae! And the remark went unchallenged. 
I wonder if the graduates— rather mythical heroes, so 
far as influence about the Campus is concerned— I 
wonder if they realise the changes that have resulted 
from McGill’s branching out into the so-cal ed In- 
ternational sport. We have paid Jor it: we have become 
denationalised. We are looking South again, and not 

East and West. ...... 

“Mind you, I don’t discuss lor a moment the right- 
ness or wrongness of American influence, because it 
doesn’t affect my argument in the slightest. A good 



American idea is as much un-Canadian as a bad Amer- 
ican idea is. My point is that we are still seeking 
salvation from without instead of from within." 

"But the man who made that remark about our 
soon playing more games in the States was only an 
individual after all, Evans.” 

“True, but 1 am sure he docs not stand alone. There 
was a letter in the Daily to the same effect. And did 
not our President remind us that after all our whole 
system of athletics was also similar to the American? 
Did not an ex-member of the Council point out that 
our organisation of the Union was entirely American, 
and that the President attends a conference annually 
in the States in order to collect the latest ideas on Union 
management? Do these statements mean nothing? 
As I see it, the students of McGill were told that op- 
position to American ideas was useless because we were 
already organised on American lines. And yet we still 
talk about the Scotch tradition, and vote our Lord 
Rectorship. Ye Gods!” 

“Don’t get angry, Evans. You always dislike being 
on the losing side." The Council, the Athletic Board, 
and a great majority of students are against you.” 

“So is Mr. Shaughnessy, McCrae. I suppose I had 
better recognise that I represent a lost cause.”

Two Epigrams 

( From the Italian of De Rossi, 1753-1827)

AH. friendly Spring, 

1 * Thou dost a joyous band of pleasures bring 
That stay with us, in truth, too short a time, 

And yet return each year in all their prime. 

In every way 
Like thine, my April-day, 

My youth, brought joys and pleasures in its train, 
But it, alas, has flown, and will not come again. 

11 

I OVE would’heap scorn upon her sister Spring, 

For the brief stay and hasty sojourning 
Of her stray flowers. 

But that fair Season answered: “.Ah, then those, 

Thy amorous hours, 

Outlast, perhaps, the blooming of my rose?”. Ztcff 

F. R. Scott. 



What Strange Enchantment 

W HAT strange enchantment 
Out of Faery 
Or the land of flowers 

Have you woven over me three times 
That the shy glances of your eyes 
Are the meshes of a netj 
For my limbs, 

And the dark sheen of your hair 
Candle-light 

For my moth thoughts. 

And your white breasts 
Twin moons 
To draw my tides?

THE BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
(Continued from page 6) 

in no way to the others, but stands as a pretty inci- 
dental piece in light minuet style; the third {Allegro 
motto vivace,) stands equally alone, as a theme, and 
fulfils the part of a finale, with its great crescendo of 
brasses and drums. The fourth movement, an adagio 
lamentoso, serves as an epilogue, totally unconnected 
with the preceding parts. 

The flawless interpretation of this, Tchaikowsky’s 
generally acknowledged master-work, allowed no room 
for anything but praise for Kussevitzky. 

Dukas' "Apprenti Sorcier” was placed as third 
number on the programme (probably) as a concession 
to people who like a jolly piece and enjoyable rhythm. 
I recalled Debussy’s “Golliwogs Cakewalk” and the 
“Funeral March of The Marionnettes”. 

The fourth number, Ibert’s “Escales” was adver- 
tised as for first performance in Montreal. À thin 
composition of the tone-poem and descriptive music 
variety, this first performance could justly be the last. 
We should always be glad to hear a "First time m 
Montreal”; but we may with good reason demand 
that it lie something unique, such as, Scriabmi s 
“Poeme de l’Extase”, or Stravinsky’s "Oiseau de Beu . 

The fifth and final number on the programme, 
Berlioz's "Rakoczy March” from the “Damnation 
of Faust", can only be looked upon as a gratuitous 
offering.

the harper prize short story 

(Continued from page 4) 

by the same person, Charles Caldwell Dobie, the only 
writer who was declared twice a prize-winner. Ills first 
tale is of crime, its causes and detection as well as its 
iudgment. There is a criminal expert who thought 
he knew more about criminals than they themselves. 
At least, as a result of his own complacency, he found 
himself in a terrible predicament; only through the 
generosity of the one he had condemned was he ex- 
tricated therefrom. 

Lack of space prevents taking up all of the twelve 
prize stories ; they are not indeed equally meritorious, 
but all of them are readable while some appear to be 
artistically perfect. Those of us who are old enough 
to remember the pristine glory of the publishing house 
of Harper, especially as expressed m Harper s Magazine, 
the literary' queen of the nineties, welcome sincerely 
their new efforts to bring about a revival of the short 
story in American belles-lettres.
