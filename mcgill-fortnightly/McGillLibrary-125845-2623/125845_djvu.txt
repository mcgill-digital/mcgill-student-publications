O NE has recently heard among McGill students 
such phrases as the following: “a dignified 
compliance with the will of the majority”, ‘‘it 
is poor sportsmanship to object to a decision reached 
by the majority”, these “issues have become dead, 
and must cease to be discussed.” 

There is behind all of these utterances a definite 
philosophy; a philosophy, which although perhaps 
not yet systematized in the minds of its adherents, 
amounts to a complete negation of individualism. 
Its devotees seek to elevate the will of the majority 
to an eminence only slightly inferior to that of the 
Most High; they listen to Vox Populi rather than to 
the “still, small voice.” 

The fallacy of this pseudo-democratic slaatswissen - 
schaft lies in fundamentally assuming the possibility of 
legislating ultimate truth. It is possible that, with 
the advance of theoretical science, a time may come 
when man will be face to face with ultimate truth; 
but, at present, a majority vote is at best a sh rewd 
guess, or a fairly safe bet as to the next dido of the 
Eternal Flux. 

A silent compliance with majority decisions seems 
to us basically absurd, even if on no other grounds 
than that opposition is an absolute necessity in the 
evolution of any system. In a university such as' 
McGill a very intricate system of student polity has 
evolved,— supposedly by a long series of divisions, 
the vote of the majority, in every case, deciding in 
which new direction the evolution would continue- 
If, however, the decisions of the majority are to be 
held sacrosanct, free from criticism, and subjected 



to little, if any opposition, the student polity which 
is in the course of evolution will lack the strength 
and vigour that comes of surmounting criticism and 
opposition. Then again there is the possibility (will 
any one venture to deny it?) that a majority may be 
wrong; while in an ignorant community, or among 
those whose education is in a state of incompletion, 
it is arguable that the decisions of the majority are 
more often wrong than right. 

We should, then, like to claim for ourselves the 
right to criticise certain aspects of the present student 
organization at McGill. Our criticisms will be our 
sincere opinions. But that they will represent our 
opinions does not imply that we fail to recognize the 
opinions of those who see things in a different light, 
or that we wish to lay claim to any infallibility or 
occult knowledge.

W HATEVER sympathy one may feel for the 
aims of the Canadian Authors’ Association 
and however eagerly one may hope for the 
creation of a worthy national literature, it is impossible 
to view the excesses of "Canadian Book Week” in a fav- 
orable light. Publicity, advertising and the methods of 
big business are not what is required to foster the art 
and literature of a young country such as Canada, while 
the commercial boosting of mediocre Canadian’books 
not only reduces the Authors’ Association to the level 
of an advertising agency but does considerable ham r 
to good literature. After all, it is not so much Canadian 
books that we should like to see the public buy, as 
good Canadian books; and as there are not very many 
of these latter yet, we should be very well content

QTUDENT activities at McGill vary considerably, 
McGill must indeed be almost an epitome of the 
whole world to contain within itself both a 
“Players* Club” and a “Scarlet Key Society/' 
Those who were at McGill last year will remember 
with pleasure the first production of the then newborn 
Players' Club — how, labouring under almost every 
possible handicap it, was able to offer a presentation 
which placed it at once in the first rank of local 
amateur companies. 

This year Montreal is to be favoured with two pro- 
ductions by the Club, we learn. The first one, which 
is opening as we go to press, sounds all that we could 
hope. The names of Bernard Shaw and Alfred Sutro 
coupled with the standard of acting of last year, seem 
to us a guarantee of interesting and pleasant enter- 
tannent. We are not well acquainted with Francis 
Gribble, author of the third play, but are trusting to 
the discretion of the producing committee. 

It is our opinion that a University should be a 
dignified and learned Institution. That it may be 
this, the activities of its Students should show these 
qualities. Regrettably, such cannot be said of all 
the doings of McGill students. But, when we are 
called upon to draw attention to the Players' Club, 
we have no hesitation in assuring our public that its 
offerings are truly worthy of a University, and that 
they may learn from them something of the virtue, 
which is in McGill.

Thrasymachus and Socrates 

A Dialogue 

A. Edel 

B Y Zeus, Socrates, what is wrong today? You are 
quibbling over every word of mine. When I said 
Clearchus was a good man, surelv I knew what 
1 meant. 

You may know, Thrasymachus, but tell me that I 
too may know, what is this quality in man which we 
call goodness. Let me share in this common knowledge, 
if such, indeed, it be. 

But surely, Socrates, you know what goodness is — 
goodness in man, in an animal, in an object — let us 
say in a book, , . . 

I am not so sure that I do, Thrasymachus, but since 
you seem so well informed tell me what is goodness 
in a book — in short what is a good book? 

Why let me see— T would say T and I think you will 
agree with me, that a good book is one which is of some 
intellectual value to the reader and is at the same time 
of aesthetic value, or if you wish, to put it simply, is 
entertaining in style. 

Must a book be both intellectually beneficial and 
at the same time entertaining in order to be called 
good? 

That is what I said, Socrates. 

And then is a text-book, say about the topography 
of Sicily, or one that is extremely technical, to be 
regarded as no good by those who, not being interested 
in the subject, consider it not entertaining? 

No, the book may still be a good one. 

Then it seems that a book can be called good when 
only of intellectual, but not of aesthetic, value? 

So it seems, Socrates. 

Then is it not equally true that a book may be of 
aesthetic but yet of no intellectual value? 

It seems probable, but 1 do not quite see what vou 
are aiming at. 

Let us clear this point up first. A book on a subject 

which has been fully discussed everywhere on a 

subject which is no longer of interest to anyone, is of 
no intellectual value. But let it be written in a style 
that you admire and you will call it a good book will 
you not? 

Certainly. 

Then a book of aesthetic value only may still be 
considered as possessing this quality of goodness. That 
is certain, is it not? 

We agreed on that already, Socrates. 

Now consider this, Thrasymachus,— can not a book 
written m a wonderful style contain ideas that are 
harmful, just as in cooking a most appetizing and well- 
flavored dish can contain poison? 

That is likely enough. 

And is it not possible that this book, by sheer force 
of style and presentation, may convince the reader 
that its contents are the true products of reason though, 
as 1 have said belore, its ideas, if put into practice, be 
really and truly harmful. 

Indeed it may be so. 

Then is not the book harmful? 

Most certainly it is, if it has a corrupting influence 
such as you describe. 

But we decided before that a book was good even 
if it was only of aesthetic value. Then is this book both 
good and bad at the same time?

Symbolism in Poetry 

A. J. M. Smith 

S YMBOLISM is as old as the first picture writing 
or the first spoken guttural, for words themselves 
are nothing but symbols to which we have agreed 
to give a certain significance originally as arbitrary 
as die letters which compose them or the sounds into 
which they are translated. "It is in and through 
Symbols”, says Carlyle, “that man, consciously or 
unconsciously, lives, works, and has his being”. 
Symbolism began in Eden when the first man named 
the creatures of his newly created world; or, before 
that, in the void, when God separated the light from 
darkness— "and called the light Day, and the darkness 
he called Night”. 

It is in its earliest beginnings, Mr. Arthur Symons 
declares, that we can see precisely what symbolism 
in literature really is: — “A form of expression, at the 
best but approximate, essentially but arbitrary, until 
it has obtained the force of a convention, for an unseen 
reality apprehended by the consciousness”. In this 
definition Mr. Symons stresses the importance of the 
time element in the creation of a symbol, and implies 
the existence of traditional bonds, the very strength 
and firmness of which give to the symbolist poet a 
freedom of expression that can be obtained in no other 
way. Though a symbol may at first have been 
arbitrarily chosen, long association has created a 
hidden correspondence, and traditional usage has 
endowed it with a mystical significance, changing 
what was once but an approximate expression to a 
reflection of the unseen reality for which it stands. 

Symbolism, thus, in the more special meaning which 
it has acquired with time, is an attempt to express 
the inexpressible, to “hold infinity in the palm of your 
hand and eternity in an hour". It is the language of 
Mysticism, which, ever tending toward a more tenuous 
subtlety, seeks to give an outward form of expression 
to emotions, intuitions, half-thoughts and gleams 
which are as shadowy and elusive as a rare perfume 
or a chord of music. "A Symbol”, writes Mr. W. B. 
Yeats in an essay on William Blake, “is the only pos- 
sible expression of some invisible essence, a transparent 
lamp about an invisible flame.” 

This mystical significance of symbolism was 
acknowledged by Carlyle, who points out that in the 
Symbol proper there is always, more or less distinctly 
and directly, an embodiment and revelation of the 
Infinite. “In a symbol”, he says, "the Infinite is made 
to blend itself with the Finite, to stand visible, and 
as it were, attainable there”. It is by means of symbols 
alone that the soul can give some embodiment to the 
apprehended wisdom that waits upon loneliness, 
reverie, solitude. “There is a solitude of space”, 
wrote Emily Dickinson: 

"There is a solitude of space, 

A solitude of sea, 

A solitude of death, but these 
Society shall be. 

Compared with that profounder site, 

That polar privacy, 

A Soul admitted to Itself; 

Finite Infinity.” 

It is of this intense subjectivity, this inner solitude, 
that Symbolism is the interpreter. It is somewhat 
like prayer in being a communion of the microcosm 
with the macrocosm, the ego with the Infinite, the 



individual soul with God. George Herbert has a sonnet 
which is an attempt to define Prayer in a series of 
more or less subtle and metaphysical phrases. He calls 
it, among other things, “the Church’s banquet”, 
“the Soul in paraphrase”, "reversed thunder”, “a 
kind of tune”, “exalted Manna", “Heaven in 
ordinary”, “man well dressed”, “the bird of Paradise”, 
“Church’s bells beyond the stars heard”, “the soul’s 
blood”; then in conclusion comes a phrase, the sim- 
plicity, charm and exquisite rightness of which stir 
the emotions as the cleverness of the others pleases 
the intellect. The final phrase is: “something under- 
stood”. Here, at last, prayer is truly and beautifully 
defined. To bring out the analogy between prayer 
and symbolism, I can do no better than define the 
latter as "something almost understood”. 

The element of mystery, indeed, is one that is ever 
present in symbolism. There is a sense of far horizons, 
of an undiscovered country, of a beauty we can only 
signify, not describe. A symbol has, in fact, been 
characterized as “a representation which does not 
aim at being a reproduction”. Originally, the word 
was used by the Greeks to denote the two halves of 
the tablet which they divided among themselves as 
a pledge of hospitality. Later it was used for every 
sign or rite by which those initiated in a mystery made 
themselves known to each other; gradually, however, 
the word extended its significance until it came to 
mean the representation of idea by form, of the unseen 
by the visible, of the Infinite by the finite. “In 
a symbol", to quote Sartor Resartus again, “there is 
concealment yet revelation: hence, therefore, by 
Silence and by Speech acting together, comes a double 
significance”. A certain amount of obscurity, evoca- 
tion, and suggestion is implied in all symbolist poetry. 
“The essential characteristic of symbolist art”, says 
Jean Moréas, “consists in never going so far as the 
conception of the idea in itself”. The reader or hearer 
thus becomes a partner in the poet’s task. He must 
bring with him some gift of interpretation, sometimes 
of divination and is allowed by the poet “the delicious 
joy of believing he creates”. 

A representation, then, rather than a reproduction, 
and mingling in its speech something of silence, a 
Symbol is the ritual of a mystery. It is something 
“almost” understood; yet in that one word “almost” 
lurks all the added beauty of a loveliness partially 
hidden. The “almost" qualifying the "understood" 
is the veil which adds a subtle charm to a woman’s 
face, or the thin drapery that makes the shadowy 
limbs of the dancer more beautiful, more haunting, 
than final nude. 

This element of suggestion rather than direct state- 
ment is, perhaps, the chief characteristic of the 
Symbolist poets who arose in France at the close of 
the last century, and whose methods and ideals are 
in much of the work of Mr. W. B. Yeats. In Mr. Yeats, 
symbolism is a definite repudiation of the spirit of 
has age, a rejection of the scientific materialism, the 
bleak morality and the easy objectivity of much of 
the literature of the later nineteenth century. “The 
scientific movement”, he writes, “brought with it a 
literature which was always tending to lose itself in 
externalities of all kinds, in opinion, in declamation, 
in picturesque writing, in word-painting. ...” A reac- 
tion was inevitable, however, “and now”, he continues, 
"writers have begun to dwell upon the element of 
evocation, of suggestion, upon what we call the sym- 
bolism of great writers”. 

It is not, of course, to be imagined that symbolism 



12 



The McGill Fortnightly Review 



is a new thing, a cieation or fad of the Nineties. The 
religious ritual of the Greek mysteries is full of sym- 
bolism. The cross is a symbol; so is the crown of thorns, 
the purple robe, the sponge, the bowl, the spear and 
the nails for hands and feet. Mediaeval architecture 
is alm ost wholly symbolic. Dante is a symbolist; so is 
Blake; so is the Hebrew poet who wrote of the pitcher 
broken at the well, the golden bowl shattered, and 
the silver cord loosened. 

What is new, however, is the use of a conscious 
technique based on evocation and suggestion, and the 
deliberate determination not to tell all. One of the 
earliest and best expositions of this symbolist technique 
is found in Verlaine's Art Poétique. “De la musique 
avant toute chose”, cries this most musical of the 
Symbolistes, 

“Et pour cela préfère l’Impair 

Plus vague et plus soluble dans l’air, 

Sans rien en lui qui pèse ou qui pose.” 

The emphasis upon suggestion and evocation is strong: 
“Rien de plus cher que la chanson grise où l’Indécis 
au Précis se joint.” The image or idea is likened to 
“des beaux yeux derrière des voiles.” There is to be 
no emphasis on colour; “Pas la couleur, rien que la 
nuance.” The importance of rhyme, greatly over- 
estimated by the Romantics and Parnassians alike, 
is to be reduced to its more appropriate level. 

Verlaine’s music lies not only in his very subtle use of 
rhyme, the placing of unemphatic words in the rhyme 
position and the use of assonance and half rhymes, but 
in the harmonious variation of the vowel sounds within 
the line, and the frequent use of an internal rhyme. 
The result was, in the words of Coppée, a poetry, "at 
once naive and subtle, made up of fine shades, evoking 
the most delicate vibrations of the nerves, the most 
fleeting impressions of the heart. . .poetry in which the 
verse, still verse, and exquisite verse, is already music”. 

The Symbolist conception of the purpose of rhythm 
and music in poetry has been well summed up by Mr. 
Yeats. “The purpose of rhythm, it has always seemed 
to me,” he says, "is to prolong the moment of con-

BOOKS 

One Increasing Purpose 
By A. S. M. Hutchinson 
Toronto: Musson Book Company. 

T HIS is one of those unfortunate becks on which 
the geds of commerce smile at birth. Every one 
knows of Mr. Hutchinson; everyone, with the 
exception of a small number of the discriminating, 
awaited with interest the arrival of this, his latest 
child. And now we have it. The multitudes are rushing 
to the crib, to behold— what? An enfant horrible, form- 
less, tabid, and unwell. 

The story is the story of three brothers, Andrew, 
Charles and Simon Paris. Two of them are used but 
as literary foils, whose lives set off to better advantage 
the character of the third, the chosen one; and being 
mere foils, and afflicted with no purpose, increasing 
or upsetting, they lead intelligible lives, and Mr. 
Hutchinson draws them with fair skill and imagina- 
tion. Linda Paris, Andrew’s wife, is particularly well 
done. The third brother, Simon Paris, is he upon whom 
the Purpose has fallen. He has escaped threugh five 
years of active service in the war, and the seemingly 
miraculous fact of his survival, when so many of his 



fellow's were destroyed, convinces him that his life 
has become essential to the working out or some divine 
plan; that he has, in fact a purpose. In a manner 
faintly reminiscent of Bentham in Mr. Wells’ ‘Research 
Magnificent’, and dangerously near to a plagiarism 
of that same author’s Mr. Britfing, the now inspired 
Simon proceeds to search for the answer to the very 
fundamental and disturbing questions that are moving 
him. What is this Purpose? What is this thing for 
which not only himself, but all this post -'war genera- 
tion is seeking? Where can be found the panacea for 
the spiritual ills of the age? 

Had Mr. Hutchinson something to offer us in the 
way of a solution to the eternal problems which he 
raises, he might have made of this novel a message 
or a profession of faith, and thus, have atoned in some 
degree for the other faults— such as the execrable style 
of the book. But not so, Simon’s mind (and therefore , 
we may not unfairly presume, Mr. Hutchinson’s) is 
barren of anything more intellectual than vague Ques- 
tioning, and anything more emotional than what might 
be termed a generous sympathy, ever bordering upon 
the sentimental. So the increasing Purpose does not 
occupy much space in the body of the book. The 
domestic affairs of the two other brothers are treated 
at great length, and with constant recapitulation; 
Charles, morbid and self-centred, we accompany from 
childhood to a timely suicide, and Andrew we follow 
through all the usual uncertainties of an upper-class 
marriage to the hackneyed climax of the discovery 
of love through suffering . The unfolding of the Purpose 
takes place in between these other more popular scenes. 
And when at last we attain to it (if our patience has 
held out so long) what have we? Simon, working from 
the discovery of the lack of Christian charity in most 
human relationships, becomes a convert to that 
unstable form of Christianity which is three parts 
sentiment and one part philanthropy, and which is 
well expressed by one of the minor characters: “I 

went to Church with my mother as a kid; I shall be 
buried bv the Church; in between I am dashed if I 
scoff at the Church”. And then (and this is the crown- 
ing banality) just as Simon seems on the point of 
making a genuine sacrifice in order that he may go 
forth as an itinerant preacher, dedicated to his new- 
found Purpose, along comes the woman of his love, 
and we have this typically dnematographical ending: 
“Go, (she says), unfettered, with no thoughts except 
thought of your Purpose, just for one year.... If 
with so much then done and learnt all that remains 
can more easily be done with me to help you — why, 
then — And they embrace. 

We think that one year is a fair estimate of the time 
that Simon's Purpose — and Mr. Hutchinson’s novel 
— will last.

The Cry of A Wandering Gull 

T HE cry of a wandering gull, 

And the far cry in the lonely air 
Of the crows in the cool 
Of the evening, share 
With the boom of the tide 
On the hollow shore 
All the sorrowful words I cried 
And thought to cry no more.

Sentimentalism in Education 

“Vespasiano" 

D ICKENS, though never an artist, cut a fair figure 
as a social reformer. He was one of those who 
voiced humanitarian doctrines through the 
medium of sentimentalism. Unfortunately his spirit- 
ual descendants have become a mere rag, tag and 
bobtail, and among them emphasis has gravitated 
wholly and solely to the sentimental. They now achieve 
little beyond downright harm, and in the realm of 
education that harm is perhaps a more serious menace 
than elsewhere. Since Dickens’ time the trend has 
been to make education more pleasant. It has taken 
two directions, the first to make education more in- 
teresting and alluring in itself, and the second to make 
the extrinsic inducements to learn kinder and more 
humane. Unfortunately both these tendencies are 
being carried to extremes. 

The first may be seen in its worst form in the schools, 
unfortunately on the increase every day, in which 
some “patent” method of instruction tes been adopted. 
A large class is that in which the pupils are carefully 
protected from receiving instruction in any subject 
which they dislike. There are some which go so far as 
to require pupils to work only when they feel disposed 
to do so. The advocates of these palpable idiocies 
commonly justify them on the ground that they 
enable the pupil to develop his natural capacity for 
subjects for which he is adapted, and save him the 
irksomeness of labouring fruitlessly at subjects for 
which he has no ability. 

At this two criticisms may be levelled. In the first 
place very few people are able to find vocations, which 
require of them exercise only of their natural capacities; 
the best they may hope for in our present age is 
a vocation which requires the exercise more of their 
capacities than of their incapacities. If the latter 
are wholly undeveloped, then they are effectually 
prevented from succeeding in any vocation whatever. 
This is viewing the question on the surface; the obverse 
side of it provides a deeper criticism. No man can 
ever hope to achieve anything unless he is ready and 
able to face and overcome difficulties within himself. 
Unless he is prepared to grapple with that element 
of his occupation which draw's upon his incapacities, 
he will arrive T nowhere. As our moralists would say, 
he is a weak man. And this is precisely what the 
“patent” schools are doing; they are turning out weak 
men, and adding to the coming generation a quota of 
low moral fibre. 

The fact of the matter is plain. Children must be 
taught how to do what they do not like; otherwise 
they will be utterly unable to meet[the demands adult 
life will make upon them. 

Now as to the question of softening the means of 
compulsion. This of course makes a plainer and more 
obvious appeal to the sentimentalist and consequently 
its abuse is more widespread. Flogging such as Dickens 
decried is doubtless brutal, but to condemn it on that 
ground is about as sensible as to condemn the extrac- 
tion of decayed teeth because the operation is painful. 
The practice must be judged by its results. These 
results are, however, somewhat obscure, and a more 
general and philosophical verdict is safer. 

In order to arrive at this, let us take account also 
of more modern conditions. Corporal punishment 
has become in general lighter and less frequent, and 
other punishments have decreased in proportion. 
Can it be said that the modern youth is more pleasant

and capable than his father and grandfather? Perhaps 
one of the best gauges of social conditions in England 
is our contemporary “Punch”. It has no true equiva- 
lent on this continent, but conditions, at least in such 
broad matters as this, are much the same both here 
and in England. A current which has appeared in 
“Punch” in the last twenty years and was not to be 
found there before, is concerned with the precocity, 
superficiality, and general nastiness of the modem 
youth. One’s own experience bears this out. His 
interests lie chiefly in exaggerations— sure sign of 
decadence — license of the sex inpulse, particularly 
in its indirect forms, an instance of which may be 
found in the simultaneous increase and sensualisation 
of dancing; immense enthusiasm for sports, which 
have now universally degenerated into mere profes 
sional gladiatorial shows; and so on ad libitum. And 
the main cause of all these things is that the modem 
youth has never been taught to control his appetites, 
whether physical or spiritual. 

Now the question is as to the remedy. George 
Bernard Shaw, having observed that the cat, if left 
alone, will always clean itself, but, once washed by 
external agency, will never again perform its own ab- 
lutions, concluded that the best way to induce a cat 
to clean itself was to throw a bucket of mud over it. 
But dear Mr. Shaw has such a logical mind; Nature 
has not. It sounds very well to say with Mr. Shaw 
that the best way to produce an efficient student is to 
offer him only those tasks which are completely and 
utterly impossible to him; but unfortunately experience 
shows that the result of this is that he emerges a 
poltroon and an ignoramus. Likewise the boy who has 
been flogged until he cannot sit down with comfort 
for the rest of his life, does not acquire the stamina 
to apply himself to unpleasant things, but only a 
distorted common sense, which prompts him to run 
away from everything. 

The solution is plainly an equable balance. By all 
means take pains to develop inherent ability in its 
own direction, but by no means omit the all-round 
basis which is essential for every occupation; let the 
patent schoolmen run down a steep place into the sea. 
Punish to the extent, and with the physical directness, 
necessary to teach decent restraint, but avoid perse- 
cution so brutal as to crush out all active ambition. 
Moderation in all things.

Let me build a woodland shrir.e,

ART 

The Royal Canadian Academy 

J UST why painting alone of the Arts should have 
deigned to take a firm root in our native Canadian 
soü it would be difficult to detenrdne. But that it has 
so taken root few who visit this exhibition will be 
bold enough to question. It is true there are no can- 
vasses here which one could designate as great, and 
many are (to speak kindly) simply immature; but 
there undoubtedly are enough possessing originality 
and genuine quality to stir the imagination and even 
enthusiasm of these who are interested in the artistic 
development of this country. 

The cold splendor of Harold Beament’s “The 
Mountain”, at the head of the entrance stairway, 
is a proper introduction to the winter landscapes 
which as a group are the most distinctive element in 
the exhibition. All the loneliness and brooding silence 
ol the northern hills are here. In a less rugged form 
these qualities are to be found also in the only Cullen, 
a picture whose beauty is no whit diminished by our 
familiarity with this genre. Mr. j. W. Beatty’s work is 
an interpretation ol a similar sort, though less convin- 
cing; we doubt if such rich foliage as he has pul in his 
“Madawaska Valley” can be found alter that depth 
of snow has fallen. But of all the pictures of this class 
there is none to rival, in boldness of colour and design, 
the "Lake McArthur" of J. E. H. Macdonald, who 
seems to have captured here all the strength and 
grandeur of the Rockies. 

What may be called the domestic winter scene (our 
Dutch Interior) can be viewed to happy advantage 
in “Noontime in the Hills”, by A. H, Robinson, in 
A. Y. Jackson's “Early Spring”, P. C. Sheppard’s 
“Blue Sleigh”, and numerous others. The excellent 
view of Quebec from Levis, by R. W. Pilot, shows 
that artist in his most capable mood. One realises the 



difficulties”to be mastered in these snow scenes when 
even Mr. Gagnon in his typical “Laurentian Home- 
stead” seems to have been slightly overcome by the 
magnitude of his snow-piles. 

Among the portraits that of Gordon Payne by 
Manly Macdonald is worthy of attention; it possesses 
a liveliness and vigour not to be found to such a degree 
in the two polished and almost annoyingly clever 
Jongers. Mr. Forbes’ portrait of his wife may be 
truthfully and adequately described as charming, a 
term applicable also to Miss Vicaji’s “Elaine”. 
Number 209 of the catalogue can be safely passed by. 

No Canadian exhibition would be complete without 
a seascape by Horne Russel, and the two now on view 
are very fine examples oi his work. “The Clamdigger” 
is the better of the two; it has well caught the shimmer 
of a wet beach beneath a watery sky. One cannot 
mention the water scenes, however, without thinking 
with admiration of that delightful bit of colour, "Sea 
Craft”, by F. H. McGillivray. 

Suzor-Coté fills a lacuna with his able studies in 
the nude, all of whom turn their backs to the onlooker 
as if ashamed of their undrapery. It is strange that 
our Canadian painters are paying so little attention 
to the human form ^possibly this is a sign of imma- 
turity, which time will remedy. But what a contrast 
to a Parisian Salon 1

A Miniature Republic 

F . R. Scott 

T HE Republic of Andorra is a miniature state that 
lies tucked away in the midst of the Pyrenees. 
In many ways it is the most extraordinary country 
in Europe : certainly no other part of the Western Con- 
tinent is so inaccessible, so unexplored, so untouched 
by modem civilization or governed under so ancient 
and exceptional a form of constitution. Rarely, indeed, 
can a person be found who has heard so much as the 
name of the place; Baedeker's guide-books, where 
everything the European traveller can wish to know is 
compactly tabulated, dismiss the subject in a few lines 
of the smallest print, while even the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica— which takes cognizance of most of the 
affairs of mice and men — finds something less than a 
page ample space for its description. But as both these 
authorities indicate that Andorra possesses no roads 
other than mule-tracks, and no railway station within 
40 miles of its frontier, perhaps this general poverty 
of information is not to be wondered at. 

Rumours of the unique character of the country, 
from a friend who had been in the vicinity, decided a 
small party of us who were intending to visit Southern 
France to include Andorra in our itinerary. We fore- 
gathered in Paris one September afternoon, having 
come from various parts of England, and that same 
evening took the P, L. M. train for Avignon. From 
that starting point, after seeing the Palace of the Popes 
(a veritable fortress which gave the term "Babylonish 
Captivity” a new significance), we progressed by easy 
stages through Arles, Nimes and Narbonne to Car- 
cassonne, from whose embattled heights we could make 
out the dim outline of the mountains of our pilgrimage. 
We were now but 50 miles from the boundary of 
Andorra; but no trains, of course, were of much use 
to us, and to our delight even the clerk in the tourist- 
office of Carcassonne could give us no information as

to how we should reach our destination. Truly, we 
said to ourselves, the Republic must be well hidden 
when people so close know so little about it. 

There was a small town in the mountains to the east 
of Andorra, named Puigcerda, which was quite easily 
approached by means of an electric train and a motor- 
bus. Towards this we made our way, for we felt sure 
that once there we should find out the details about 
the rest of the journey. It still delights and terrifies me 
to think back upon that motor ride amongst the gorges 
of the Pyrenees, through which our driver dashed at 
reckless speed, one hand on the wheel and the other 
winding a feeble horn, while we looked fearfully at 
the cliffs on the one side and the chasms on the other. 
On reaching Puigcerda we soon discovered the informa- 
tion we desired; but it came as a shock to us. A daily 
bus service to Andorra was in operation. 

This news, while it solved the transportation problem, 
was indeed a blow to the members of our party. The 
Romance of Andorra seemed shattered. What I A 
daily char-a-banc running to the Hidden Republic! 
Across our minds flashed visions of idle globe trotters, 
tweed-clad tourists, and all other banes that busses 
bring. We were dejected; we looked sorrowfully at 
one another. But being optimists we reserved our seats 
for the following day. 

That ride to Vieille-Andorra, as the capital of the 
country is called, re-created the romance of Andorra 
in our minds. Our way lay for 70 miles along the bot- 
tom of deep valleys, and although the bridle-path of 
the guide-books had been replaced by a road, there 
were places where we wondered how anything on wheels 
could ever pass along it. Numerous mountain streams 
ran over instead of under the roadway, and each, in 
proper streamlet fashion, had worn for itself a small 
gully over which we had to drive. Only the marvellous 
springing of the Hispano-Suiza bus saved the machine — 
and ourselves — from breaking down. As we swayed 
about hour by hour inside the vehicle, in company 
with the strangest assortment of peasants, priests and 
village folk, with the rain falling in torrents on the 
roof and dark clouds lending a sombre aspect to the 
lofty hills about us ,the disillusionment of the previous 
day rapidly gave place to a new faith in the inacces- 
sibility and aloofness of the country we had come to 
visit, — a faith the stronger because we realized that 
this was the only road connecting the capital of An- 
dorra with the outside world. 

Despite this foretaste of discomfort we found very 
passable accommodation at the one inn which the capi- 
tal possessed. The food, though plain, was always 
eatable (if I except the one occasion when a complete 
chicken’s head appeared in a stew) and the beds were 
free from “pulex tyrannus”, that “great Continental 
bugbear," as it has been called. Our host appeared a 
trifle surly and persisted in wearing his hat while 
waiting on us at table, but his wife and family were 
most agreable and showed a great interest in our 
doings. And when we moved from the capital to a 
little village called Escalda^ we were even better housed, 
for the “hotel” at that place had been enterprising 
enough to tap a hot spring that bubbled from the 
mountain side and so provided gratis splendid warm 
baths at any hour of the day or night, — a most unusual 
state of affairs for Europe. 

We discovered many interesting facts about the 
constitution and customs of the state. Andorra lacks 
absolute independence; she is obliged to pay in altern- 
ate years 960 francs to the French Government and 
460 francs to the Bishop of Urgel in Spain, and these

two powers each appoint a “viguier” or overseer to 
command the Andorran militia and administer criminal 
justice. As there are no written laws the decisions of 
the viguiers are simply personal judgments. But apart 
from these limitations, wlüch were fixed by a document 
drawn up in 1278, Andorra rules herself. A President 
is at the head of affairs, assisted by a Council of 21 
delegates elected from the six parishes which compose 
the state. Two special magistrates advise the viguiers 
and keep them lrom infringing the customs of the coun- 
try. The official language is Catalan, the coinage 
Spanish, and the post-office sells French or Spanish 
stamps according to the destination of the letter. 

The character of Andorra was most vividly 
portrayed in the “Casa de la Vail,” which for lack of 
a better term I must call the seat of Government. It 
was a rude two-storey stone building. We were ushered , 
into it one morning with all due solemnity (after a 
small boy had been despatched to find the key) by 
an old woman as humble and rustic in appearance as 
her surroundings. She unlocked and opened the soli- 
tary door; we entered— and found ourselves in a stable. 
“For the horses of the Councillors, 1 ’our guide hastened to 
explain. We then mounted a stairway and were shown 
a school-room with desks for about 20 pupils; such 
children as cared to seek it were given free instruction. 
Immediately opposite was a banqueting hall, by far 
the best room in the building. We passed from this 
to the Council Chamber itself. Here were the robes of 
the Councillors, hanging on pegs behind dingy 
curtains; here in a cupboard let into the wall, the door 
of which could only be unlocked when the head 
Councillors from each of the six parishes were present 
with their keys, were kept the state documents,

including the all-important charter of 1278; and here 
we were shown a gruesome steel instrument which 
proved on examination to be a garotte, — still the legal 
method of executing criminals, but, needless to say, 
never required today. Opening from this chamber 
(which by, the way, is also the only law court 
in the country) was a miniature chapel, and it 
was delightfully typical of everything we had seen 
that the President’s ceremonial hat should be kept in 
a white band-box on a bench in a corner, and that our 
conductress should insist with childish eagerness that 
each of us should try it on. 

Oui' party had a farewell dinner at Escaldas, and 
the following morning myself and two others set out 
for Puigcerda. The bus had stopped running while we 
were at Andorra, the summer season being over, so we 
were compelled to take a small horse-diligence that 
left at 5.00 A.M. We were the only passengers when 
we started. It appeared to us that four people inside 
the conveyance, with one outside by the driver, would 
be the utmost it could carry, but before we reached 
the end of the journey to Urgel where we were to con- 
nect with another line of buses, there were eight people 
with their luggage (including one squirrel in a cage) 
squeezed into the interior, while two more were sitting 
out in front. 



THRASYMACHUS AN D^SOCRATES 

(Continued from page 10) 

It can not be both anyhow, Socrates, but the fact 
is we have become quite confused in our reasoning. 

No, Thrasyrrmchus, it is not that— the original defini- 
tion which leads us to such conclusions must be wrong. 

What then do you call a good book? 

I may call a certain book good, my friend, and you 
may not. I may derive benefit from reading it* Some- 
one else may not. I may like the style and admire the 
writer's skill— others may not. The same book, then, 
does not appear to all to have the same degree of good- 
ness. Its goodness is what we admire in the book, and 
it is a good book, more or less, as our admiration of it 
outweighs our objection to its defects. So, my friend, 
to go over our old examples, a text-book is considered 
good if the knowledge we gain from it more than com- 
pensates for its defects in style and other points; a book 
oi doubtful intellectual value, only if its good qualities 
outweigh the inferior ones. And in each case the in- 
dividual is the judge, but a book is generally considered 
good when the majority approve it, or those outstand- 
ing literary men whose opinions the public follows. Do 
you agree then that goodness in a book is nothing more 
or less than the sum total of the qualities which we 
admire in it, its intellectual and aesthetic qualities, 
its individual appeal and so forth? 

I think you speak rightly, Socrates. 

Then let us pass on to goodness in man. Is this the 
same thing? 

It is a very interesting problem, Socrates, but I must 
be going. I do not want to miss that rugby game this 
afternoon. What is the time* by the way? 

That is too easy a question to answer. Better ask 
"What is lime?' 

Anyhow, if I do not see you for a few days or weeks 
the subject will not grow old in such a short time. 

That is the truest thing you have said today, Thra- 
symachus— such problems never grow old. 



SYMBOLISM IN POETRY 

(Continued from page 12) 

templation, the moment when we are both asleep and 
awake, which is the one moment of creation, by hushing 
us with an alluring monotony, while it holds us waking 
by variety, to keep us in that state of perhaps real 
trance, in which the mind liberated from the pressure 
of the will is unfolded in symbols”. 

To quote from Mr. Yeats on this subject is inevit- 
able. He has said the last word upon it, and in a prose 
as beautiful as any written in this century. “If people 
were to accept the theory that poetry moves us because 
of its symbolism,” he asks, “what change should one 
look for in the manner of our poetry?" His own poetry 
compared with that of Tennyson or Browning would 
provide the answer, had he not himself supplied it in 
his essays. “A return to the way of our fathers”, he 
answers, “a casting out of descriptions of nature for 
the sake of nature, of the moral law for the sake of 
the moral law, a casting out of all anecdotes and of 
that brooding over scientific opinion that so often 
extinguished the central flame in Tennyson, and of 
that vehemence that would make us do or not do 
certain things. . .With this change of substance, this 
return to imagination, this understanding that the 
laws of art, which are the hidden laws of the world, 
can alone bind the imagination, would come a change 
of style, and we would cast out of serious poetry those 
energetic rhythms. . which are the invention of the 
will with its eyes always on something to be done or 
undone; and we would seek out those wavering, 
meditative, organic rhythms, which are the embodi- 
ment of the imagination.”
